== What is Classysheet?

An *object to spreadsheet mapper* that converts Java (or Kotlin) objects
to (or from) a spreadsheet, such as Google Sheets or Excel.
It can be customized through class annotations.

== How does it work?

. Annotate your domain classes or records with an `@Sheet` annotation:
+
----
@Sheet
public class Shift {
    private String id;
    private LocalDateTime start;
    private LocalDateTime end;
    private Employee employee;
    ...
}
----
+
If another sheet uses it, add an `@IdColumn` annotation on a field:
+
----
@Sheet
public record Employee(
    @IdColumn String name,
    long age,
    double cost) {}
----

. Export it to Excel:

. Or Google Sheets: TODO


== How do I use it?

. Create a class to wrap all data that goes into the workbook:
+
----
@Workbook
public class Schedule {
    private List<Employee> employees;
    private List<Shift> shifts;
    ...
}
----

. Once, when bootstrapping your application, create the ClassysheetService singleton:
+
----
ClassysheetService<Schedule> classysheetService = ClassysheetService.create(Schedule.class);
----

. For every import/export of data from/to a spreadsheet, use read/write method on it:
+
----
Schedule schedule = ...;
classysheetService.writeWorkbookToExcel(schedule);
----

*Note*: reading is not yet supported.

== FAQ

=== Why did you name it Classysheet?

It stands for _Java class and spreadsheet_:

- `class` is short for `Java class`
- `y` is Spanish for `and`
- `sheet` is short for `spreadsheet`

=== Really?

No, not really. We just wanted to use the phrase "_It's really Classysheet!_" in presentations.

We also considered naming it _Sheetify_, but the phrase "_Let's sheetify it!_" didn't quite work.
